# CodSoft Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects completed during my internship at CodSoft. The projects are focused on different aspects of machine learning and data analysis.

## Project 1: Spam Message Detection

### Overview
This project aims to detect spam messages using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled messages to accurately classify whether a given message is spam or not. Techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) are employed to extract features from text data. The project includes an evaluation of various models, such as Support Vector Machines and Random Forest, to determine the most effective approach for spam detection.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `spam_detection` directory.
3. Follow the instructions in the `README.md` within the directory to set up and run the code.

## Project 2: Movie Genre Classifier

### Overview
The Movie Genre Classifier project focuses on predicting the genre of a movie based on certain features. It utilizes machine learning algorithms, including feature engineering, to classify movies into different genres. The project contributes to the field of content recommendation and genre-based content analysis. The dataset for this project can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb). The README includes details on the impact of different features on genre prediction accuracy.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Feature Engineering

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Go to the `movie_genre_classifier` directory.
3. Refer to the `README.md` file in the directory for instructions on setting up and running the code.

## Project 3: Credit Card Approval

### Overview
The Credit Card Approval project involves predicting credit card approval based on various financial features. The model is trained on historical data to determine the likelihood of a credit card application being approved. This project is valuable for risk assessment in financial institutions and contributes to the automation of credit approval processes. The datasets for this project are uploaded within the repository. The README includes details on the preprocessing steps applied to the data, feature selection, and the logistic regression model's performance metrics.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Data Preprocessing
- Logistic Regression

### How to Use
1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `credit_card_approval` directory.
3. Consult the `README.md` within the directory for guidance on setting up and executing the code.
